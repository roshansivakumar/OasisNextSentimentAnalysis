"1","Definitely THAT. Sadly the detail is missing from the other one and I'm finding it difficult to see what it actually is. It could be time for me to visit the optician though!"
"2","Neither. They're both adorable, especially the robin...but I can't wear heavily sequined jumpers and tops. I've got autism and all the texture and skin sensitivity issues that go with it. I look a little mad in shops because I'm always sticking my hand down the mannequin's tops to see if the fabric is too scratchy. xD"
"3","This Robin knit would be my favourite, I absolutely love little robins, when I was little my mum used to tell us when you see a robin its a love one that's no longer with us coming to check in on us. They always make me smile when I see them sitting on the fence in my garden xxx"
"4","This robin knit would be just perfect. Whenever we see a robin at Christmas we always think of my late Granddad - his birthday was on Christmas day and he would always make sure the robins and other garden birds had plenty to eat over winter, even making the bird table that still stand in our garden 20 years later. <3"
"5","This robin would be my fav! Our wee family love robins, they remind us of my lovely mum who sadly passed away two years ago. My son particularly finds comfort when a robin visits our garden. I know he would love to see me wearing a robin jumper this Christmas!"
"6","THIS <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+00A6> It's just right for those Christmas ""let's meet up when we're both shopping for a gingerbread latte' sort of socialising!  Everyone does so much partywear but I never need it! Daytime sparkle is a lot more useful!"
"7","Oh my THAT Daschund jumper is seriously on my wish list <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D> one of my favourite doggies and it’s on a Christmas jumper what more could you ask for! Would love love Love to be lucky enough to win in! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+00B6><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009B>"
"8","Got to be THAT lol as nothing comes close to a wee dachshund especially one waiting on Santa. Would definitely wear an oasis a Xmas jumper as great quality and look fantastic xxx"
"9","THIS Robin Knit for me please! We have a robin  that always visits the garden all year round,  and even eagerly eyes up our BBQ extravaganzas from up close, in hope that we will share <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009B>"
"10","That! The Dachshund! Would love this to wear for Christmas, would really love the real thing, something very special about those little dogs but not sure my 2 labradors would after. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+00B6> xx"
"11","The Robin jumper is my favourite, my mum passed away this year and she always used to say hello to the Robins as they were visitors from heaven. I like to think the one that comes to our garden is mum. X"
"12","This robin jumper would be great! I work in a school and the students love Christmas jumper day!!! I would be happy to wear this jumper this year!!! I'm also off to Finland in a few weeks - it would be a cosy jumper to wear <U+2744><U+FE0F><U+2744><U+FE0F><U+2744><U+FE0F><U+2744><U+FE0F><U+26C4><U+FE0F><U+26C4><U+FE0F><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BE><U+0084>"

"14","That Dachshund Jumper....Festive and cute...especially with the added Santa hat on the dogs head...comes in black too so will go with anything!! I won’t want to take it off #love"
"15","That....all mu little boy wants for Christmas from Santa is a puppy unfortunately due to circumstances his wish can't be granted but this jumper might put a smile on his face!"
"16","I adore the Robin, my mum always had a Robin that came into her garden and now I have a visit from one too so would love to wear this jumper as a way to remember her on Christmas <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0095>"
"17","Little robin one as it reminds me of the people who aren’t with is this Christmas. It’s gorgeous I’d wear it with a big smile for my brother xxx"
"18","That because I have a jumper with a red dachshund on it to match Ralph my real life sausage but nothing to match Rose his Black and Tan sister."
