One thing I'm definitely taking with me though is my pewter handbag that I bought from Oasis a couple of months back as it's the right size for my phone, purse, sun cream, bottle of water and keys. I don't want to be carrying around a big holdall in that weather! I'm also thinking patterned or flowery jumpsuit as that will keep my legs covered so ideal for sightseeing and will be cool still, despite the heat.

Trust me, this trip is long overdue. I'm just so happy to know that this Summer I'm going to be spending time with the people I love,and people I know who love me back.  Cant wait!
