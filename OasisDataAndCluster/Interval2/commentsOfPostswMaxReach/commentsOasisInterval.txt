"12077","My favourite flower is a gerbera and I would love to win this workshop so I could take my wonderful Mum who has been amazing since I had my little boy 9 months ago and learn all about flower arranging!!

"12078","My favourite flower is white Peony, it is stunning and reminds me of summer, I love all white flowers and my favourite white rose is an ""avalanche"", I have been a florist over 21 years and haven't been to college since the late 90s so this prize would be an absolute dream come true for me and my colleague, I would love to learn more up to date techniques from a very talented florist xxxx"
"12079","Definitely sweet peas. They are delicate, smell gorgeous and there is nothing set or sophisticated about them. They were my daughter's favourite and when she tragically died after a long battle with cancer, we asked Wild at Heart to cover her coffin with them and they looked beautiful all standing up . A field of sweet peas."
"12080","My favourite flower is the daffodil, not only is it my favourite colour but when I was little my grandad told me that when you pass away, you grow back as a daffodil and that has always stayed with mexx"
"12081","My favourite has to hydrangeas! They are big, colourful and give your garden that wow factor! Followed by peonys and and orchards. This explains why I love the floral
Collections at Oasis because the designs are based upon my fave flowers. I fell in love with the wild At heart collection and already have three pieces from the collection <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00BA> x"
"12082","My favourite flower is the Frangipani it reminds me of Australia where my nephews and nieces are, they have a big tree near them. I love the white and yellow and the warm sweet smell of them. Sadly you can't really get them over here!"
"12083","Wax flower!! Probably seems an odd choice but I think it's gorgeous and incredibly useful in all sorts of arrangements. I love roses, orchids, peonies, etc too but a huge bunch of wax looks amazing on its own but is also a great filler for hand tied bouquets, table arrangements and buttonholes <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00B8>"
"12084","I have a total obsession with Dahlias at the moment, I really want to start growing my own. I think they're so beautiful on their own - give me a bunch of cafe au lait any day! As an avid stalker of Wild at Heart I would love to gain some experience on this course, a new dress would come in handy for some upcoming weddings too! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0090><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+0097><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BF><U+00BB>"
"12085","Star of Bethlehem - small, unusual,spa  fragrant and reminder that spring has sprung. I also love Lilly of the Valley for the same reasons.
Anna - cos who doesn't love an Oasis competition?!"
"12086","My favourite has to be Amnesia roses.  I love most roses.  I love how vibrant a bunch of mixed roses can be & the range of colours you can get roses in.  I wasn't so bothered which wedding dress I had, but I knew I really wanted a bouquet of mixed colours of bright roses as my bridal bouquet & since then roses have been my favourite flowers."
"12087","I have two favourite flowers The Calla Lily, for its beauty and symplicity and The Hyacith, the colours and fragrance is heavenly. I am lucky enough to work in a florist part time and love learning about all the different flowers and learning to arrange them <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00BA><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00BA>"
"12088","Ranunculas are my absolute favorite flower, with their tissue paper like petals and they come in such a beautiful array of colours. I LOVE Nikki Tibbles Wild at Heart flowers <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00BA><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0090><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00BA>"
"12089","My favourite is Protea. A flower of South Africa where I spent many wonderful days when I was younger and still discovering myself. A flower that made me realise I will forever be wild at heart!"
"12090","Whenever I think of my favourite flower I think of Peonies. They were the main flower in my wedding bouquet and I now grow them in my garden, every year when they bloom they remind me of my perfect day. I love the fact that their season is short, they are stunning, smell amazing and you really need to appreciate how beautiful they are just by looking at them.  They remind me of summer and a traditional English garden. I have always loved flowers, this prize would be a dream come true. 
I love the way a flower can remind you of someone, a place or memory. My mum loves Freesias, my granny loved large carnations, a friend gave me love is in the mist seeds at her wedding and I saw amazing orchids in Singapore, my daughter gave me a simple bunch of daffodils for Mother's Day last year.  What's not to love, I always buy my pretty dresses from Oasis, my latest will be worn at my husbands 40th this weekend! Xx"
"12091","I love Roses, especially Orange ones. They are just so pretty and I cant help but admire them whenever I see them. The smell reminds me of being a kid and watching my grandma cutting them and placing them all around the house. I love your new ""Wild at Heart"" collection, its so pretty and I have my eye on a few items that I would love to own."
"12092","I love roses as it reminds me of my beloved gran aunt who was an avid gardener and passed on her love of gardening to my mum. Also are my house old pink roses come out every summer they are so beautiful & smell devine & they were taken from my great grandmothers house which is now demolished so precious memories for me."
"12093","Mines probably the Forget me not....is it a weed or a plant?! Who knows but it's so delicately pretty and ironically forgotten about. They make the most boring bit of grass magical-not many flowers can do that. They're like flowers for fairies.  
Why to enter...lets face it, it would be a lovely experience and I'd love some free clothes. Who wouldn't. I don't have a sob story and I'm not a florist already -the last thing I did with flowers was as a brownie (highly commended thank you very much) but I'd love it. It would be lovely to win but if not may who wins have a magical day 
X"
"12094","I know it's cliche but roses. Everything about them is appealing. They grow all year round, are so versatile & they smell divine. My mother has always wanted to open a florists and she once took me to Chelsea flower show and I remember the rose exhibition taking my breath away. Truly God's work! I fully intend to have them adorn my wedding decorations, which my mother is planning to help me with <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00B9>"
"12095","I've always wanted to become a florist ever since I volunteered in a florist aged 15. I knew it would be hard work for little pay but I loved how much creative freedom you would receive! 
I love many flowers but my favourite have to be garden flowers like agapanthus and magnolia. Whilst working at the florist I especially loved pushing in the Gerberas to a soaked funeral oasis. I enjoyed even the most mundane jobs such as emptying old water and giving new water to the flowers. But also I loved being surrounded by passionate florists determined to satisfy all their customers. 
However I was pushed into Higher Education, completed my degree and pursued a teaching career. 
Every so often I dream about giving it all up to study floristry. Please help my dream come true!"
"12096","My favourite flower is orchard I was given my first when I left my first job, then had them for my wedding bouquet and button holes just so pretty. I aslo like  Sunflowers as my first grandchild was born after a horrific year and I gave her the nick name even when my daughter was still carrying her as she is our ray of sunshine after the dark clouds <U+2600>"
"12097","How can you choose a favourite? Flowers are a gift as there is one for each mood. Snowdrops give us hope that winter will end, tulips stand like colourful centurions awaiting the coming of all the summer blooms. Sweet peas, lilac and roses fill the summer nights with heady scents of magic and romance. Whilst dahlias stay with us until the first frosts, whispering words of hope to keep us going through winter."
"12098","I have many flowers i like but i love to look out in my garden in the summer and see the Lavender buzzing with <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+009D><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+009D> and <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+009E><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B0><U+009C> and the the aroma as brush past it. Then you can harvest it and put and save it for those winter days, dry it, place it in a draw or cupboard and when you open it that smell of summer emerges again."
"12099","I just love bluebells for a number of reasons. Firstly my Mum absolutely loves them and they remind me of her, we take her to a nearby bluebell woods every year. There's something special about the bluebell woods in bloom, a sheet of blue covering the woodland floor makes it feel almost magical and it has a unique scent that I can't even describe! I look forward to seeing the bluebells every year, they are just beautiful."
"12100","I love gerberas. They r chic, simple and deep dark cerise ones remind me of my wedding day<ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00B9>. A day that was filled with love, compassion and a multitude of emotions. I  think flowers bring beauty instantly to any day and different flowers hold different memories and significance to different people. The smell, and appearance of each one is magical . Deep cerise gerberas signified the vibrance, passion and love of my wedding day and i still feel the same way 13 years on in july <U+2618><U+FE0F><U+2618><U+FE0F><U+2618><U+FE0F><U+2618><U+FE0F><U+2618><U+FE0F><U+2618><U+FE0F><U+2618><U+FE0F><U+2618><U+FE0F>."
"12101","Ooo this is a hard questions and I change my mind frequently but TODAY, it's Hydrangeas they remind me of my wedding day! We had blue Hydrangeas mixed in with deep raspberry, purple and a little bit of white flowers which included freesias, hydrangea, Veronica, Avalanche roses, eustoma, gyp and lavender. 
I would love to win this workshop so I could attempt to recreate my bouquet!"
"12102","Calla lilies. I am having them for my wedding flowers this year despite my mum and mother in law to be saying they are ""funeral flowers"". I disagree and think they are beautiful. After all Calla is Greek for beautiful. I moved into my first house last year and we have some in our front garden but equally they are pretty in a bouquet too. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0090>"
"12103","Mine is carnations, always has been. They're just so simple and classically beautiful, and they can be romantic (pinks/reds) modern (white with purple) or just plain cheerful (yellow). This prize would be awesome, i'm actually thinking of taking a floristry course! :D"
"12104","I love so many flowers, that's why I'm feeling a bit brighter now Spring is on the way. My favourites are White Lily's though, if I had to pick. Always think they look classy, and now they have a sentimental reason as my sister had  a drawing of them I did tattooed on her!"
"12105","Has to be quite simply the daffodil..they are beautiful. My Nanna always used to buy me flowers every Saturday on our shopping trip. Daffodils were my Nanna D's favourite flowers too, so when I have them in the house I have them pride of place as they bring back so many happy memories and make me smile. X"
"12106","Freesias. They are so much more than just a beautiful structured flower to look at, they smell AMAZING! My mum had them in her bouquet when she got married. She has told me that she was so nervous on her wedding day that her hands were shaking and in turn her bouquet of roses and freesias were jiggling and releasing the amazing aroma. So I think the scent always reminds her of her wedding day <U+263A><U+FE0F> And for this reason I would like them on my wedding day too <U+263A><U+FE0F> x"
"12107","My faves are daffodils/ narcissi, they remind of trips to see my nan when they would all be growing on the verges and near the hedgerows. They are a beautiful, cheery colour. They are a welcome sign that spring is on it's way. The scented varieties have a delightful and delicate smell. They're affordable and adaptable, so everyone can have them in their home or garden. They're underrated and understated. We had them as our wedding flowers for all of these reasons <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009B>"
"12108","My favourite are double lipped tulips which I had in my wedding bouquet...totally impracticality as they don't stop growing and a headache for the florist but I love them and it would be great to learn how to display them....despite 10 years of marriage and lots of hints my husband keeps 'forgetting' to buy them, so I'll like to learn how to arrange them myself <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0080>"
"12109","Definitely the Nigella Damascena, or 'love-in-a-mist'.  They're not rare and I don't think they are particularly 'in vogue', but they conjure wonderful memories of my Nanny's garden and us pressing them in on old-style flower press.  I love the dreamy name, the hues of blue and the delicate, feathered greenery - and how could you not love a flower also known as the 'ragged lady' or 'devil in the bush' !  (pic.by Fiori Della Vita)"
"12110","Anemone are the flower with the most meaning to me as my grandfather used to grow them for my grandmother. I work in a garden centre so I'm lucky enough to be surrounded by flowers of all seasons and I'm always finding new favourites. The ones that bring the most joy are wild spring flowers.. snowdrops, narcissi, bluebells, crocus, primroses and aconite as  they are a such a welcome and happy sight after the long winter months <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00BA><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00B8><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00B9><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BF><U+00B5><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00B7><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00BC><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0090>"
"12111","I love freesia! They remind me of my beautiful nan! They were her favourite flower and Sadly she died just before our wedding last year and changed my flowers at the last minute to freesia and roses to remind me that she was there in some way.  Would love to win this and learn how to make  beautiful creations incorporating this flower for my gorgeous nan!! Best of luck everyone!"
"12112","Pansies! So many different colours, their silky petals and little 'faces'. My mum always has them in her garden, and so did her mum. Now I finally have a garden of my own I'm going to get some pots for the patio bursting with pansies, as well as hanging baskets at the front of the house so they're waiting to greet me every time I get home <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A>"
"12113","I have lots of favourite flowers <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00BA>, but recently discovered Lisianthus (think that is the right spelling). A flower that looks like a rose, but is much more. Delicate, elegant and bold in colour. As a cut flower, it lasts for a long time and definitely brightens up my home <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BF><U+00A1><ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A>.

"12114","I love fresh flowers <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00BA> have to have fresh flowers in my kitchen weekly x But one of my all times favs has to be daffodils <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00BC><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00BC><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00BC> Spring is where the beauty of fashion is xx NataNatalie Johnsr be coming with me if I win <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0098>  xx"
"12115","My favourite flower <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00B8>
There are so many beautiful ones!
But one that wins my heart is the hanging basket flower commonly known as 'million bells' - calibrachoa 
Because it's such a sweet simple little flower which gives such a stunning display, with such a variety or colours if you mix them all it's like a waterfall rainbow! 
I'd love to see if you could incorporate them into a bouquet?! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00B8>"
"12116","I would have to say pink peonies, beautiful flowers and finish off arrangements very well. 

There is so many flowers I love especially ones which I chose for my wedding. You can't put a price on flowers!

"12117","I love GERANIUMS, I love how they constantly flower all over the summer days and give some beautiful colours in my flower borders and hanging baskets!
I manage to keep them over the winter by just protecting them from eliments by keeping them against the wall, saving me money in the long run <U+2764><U+2764>"
"12118","I'm struggling to choose....easier to choose the ones I don't like! I do love daffodils, spring flowers can't help but cheer up the garden after the winter. I look forward to them the most! Roses are a classic and nothing beats the smell of freesias. I would love to learn how to put together a perfect bunch of flowers, brilliant prize! X"
"12119","I love paeonies, roses, delphiniums, sweet peas, stock, jasmine, narcissi, clematis... the list never ends! Am pushing for a staff garden and allotment at work so lecturers and students can enjoy the benefits of being outdoors in a big city."
"12120","Ooo...so hard to choose only one!! My ultimate floral crush are Peonies!!!! They are in season on my birthday, the scent is incredible, the delicate layers are indulgent, they are just stunning. I love love love them!! My Mum also received the largest bouquet of just Peonies on my birth!! It was meant to be!!! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0095>"
"12121","I'd so love to win this! My favourite flower is the lily, although associated with funerals, for me it's the most beautiful, elegant, fragrant, poetic and still. I always go back to buying Lily's in various soft colours."
"12122","White Lily - several reasons
My grandma was called Lily and we always bought these for her
I had the most beautiful (and huge) Lily bouquet at my wedding
I love how magnificent their bloom is and pungent their smell"
"12123","I love different flowers throughout the seasons. My current early spring fav's are ranunculus, so pretty and natural....they remind me of paper flowers. I love the way the stems twist & the petals open slowly to reveal such an innocent beauty."

"12125","Peonies <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D>
I love the big fluffy marshmallow look they have about them. Most of all, they are super delicate and after a bit of wind and rain <U+2614><U+FE0F> they don't last. You have to be in awe of them for just a few days and that makes them extra special! <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+009C>"
"12126","There is something spectacular about Stargazers. They radiate simplistic beauty as a tall, elegant bud lightly tainted with a delicate pink and then open up to become this magnificent flower of such stunning beauty and scent. There is nothing that quite beats the scent of a Stargazer drifting through the air of a summers evening. Without doubt, my favourite flower."

"12128","I love Lilac the smell transports me back to the May Procession when I was in primary school! My grandfather had a beautiful garden full of flowers and we would go and pick beautiful bunches from it to bring into school for it! The whole school would have the most amazing smell of flowers, it was beautiful! I planted a lilac  tree last year in my own garden and I love when the flowers bloom on it! xx"
"12129","Mine is the daffodil because my grandpa is Welsh and it makes me feel close to him. When I was little I was dressed up in a traditional Welsh outfit every St David's day and gave out daffodils to our neighbours :) They always make me feel like Spring is on its way!"
"12130","I love flowers <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00BA> especially roses because they are British, elegant, timeless and beautiful just like oasis clothes! I would love to be a florist, plus I want to buy all of oasis flower print clothes this season! They look amazing!!xxxx"
"12131","I have a thing for thistles at the moment (and no, I'm not a proud Scot!) I just think they add a really nice bit of texture to displays or can equally look stunning on their own and have such a pretty colour. I would love to win this prize as I'm having difficulty choosing my wedding flowers so would be lovely to put some together myself with expert guidance to see what I like :)"
"12132","I love dahlias! They are just so gorgeous! Just looking at a dahlia makes me happy! 
I would love to win, as I'm at college for floristry just now, but that little bit ekstra experience would just be so amazing so that I hopefully one day can start my own wee flowershop <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D>"
"12133","This is such a tough question to answer. I love the delicate nature and gorgeous scent of sweet peas, they look great in a vase on their own or mixed in with other flowers. They remind me of the summer in my garden listening to the bees do their work. I love it when the sun is beating down on them wafting their perfume down the path"
"12134","Freesias are my favourites. When I was little my dad would brining home big bunches of fresh flowers every Friday and I would get a bunch of freesias so they remind me of childhood, family and my dad. Even though I had arum lilies a for my wedding bouquet, I made sure there was a little white freesia tucked away inside. 
And, did you know that not everyone can smell freesias? I'm lucky, I can <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0081>"
"12135","I love anthuriums because off there shinny and tropical  look they  remind me off being abroad in the hot sun  they also come in some  lovely vibrant colours giving them a rich and expensive look and most off all an unusual cut flower  they are  also lovely as a pot plant will surely brighten up any room as I have a red one  in my kitchen."
"12136","The Eden rose is my favourite flower. It's like the lady of the flower world...Kate Middleton if you like! The subtle colour change from pink to white and the way they don't always open fully...reserved and stunning...perfection!"
"12137","My favourite flower is the sunflower. I've recently decided to not go ahead with a fourth round of IVF and I am instead embracing all the other joys that life has to offer and trying to let myself grow into acceptance and contentment. Flowers are such a part of the beauty of the natural world - such a gift in times of sadness."
"12138","Snowdrops as they are the first little flower which appear in the New Year. When everything is still frozen and withered in the winter, and even covered with snow, the tiny little white drops appear before anything else. And you can always be sure they will soon be lit up by the first sun of spring. Since I was little we have always taken my Mum to try and find snowdrops in the Lake District as the earliest ones appear there just after Christmas. They remind me than no matter how dark and cold life gets, there's always hope <U+263A>"
"12139","Freesia's are my favourite flower. I love the variety of colours and you can't beat the perfume, it makes the whole room a pleasure to be in and puts a smile on my face. I had them in my wedding bouquet 33 years ago, so they also remind me of the most wonderful day of my life!"
"12140","A white Rose. It looks pure and sweet and elegant and beautiful, but it's strong and amazing and so full of character and despite being ""colourless"" as some people see it, it's so full of different tones  and it stands out amongst all the other colourful flowers growing. It's strong it's resilient and it's beautiful. Like a strong woman <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008A>"
"12141","<ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00B8>My favourite flowers are peonies, they remind me of my wedding day which was absolutely perfect.

"12142","I love dahlias. I love all the different vibrant colours and the little petals that make up such a beautiful flower. Best of all they remind me of my honeymoon in Seattle and the dahlia flower stalls in Pike Place Market. Whenever I see them I get the happiest memories <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D>"
"12143","I love roses for many reasons, the main one being that my Grandparents ashes are buried in the churches rose garden, I also love the beautiful scent and they bloom for weeks in my garden filling it with colour every summer."
"12144","Tulips are my ultimate flower - they are so pretty and look great in many colours! A spring flower that reminds us all that the winter is over and summer is coming! They don't have a long season so you have to enjoy them while they are here!"
"12145","My favourite flower has to be roses especially red ones,they resemble love,and for me red is one of my favourite colours,they are a happy flower and always make me smile,they always make me think back to the happy times,when I've received a single rose or bouquet of them,LOVE them.<ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00BA><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00B9>"
"12146","Gerberas are my favourite flowers for many reasons. They remind me of our wedding day (we didn't have much of a budget so we made our own bouquets for the bridesmaids). They are also so bright and always make a space look cheerful xxx"
"12147","That's a tough one as I simply love all flowers!!!
I am currently doing a floristry course at Bath College and love spending those days surrounded by flowers and getting all inspired.
My current favourite flower is probably veronica as I just love it's shape, colours and how it can transform a simple hand tied arrangement.
A rose is an all time classic though- stunning!!!!"
"12148","Peonies are my absolute favourite flower, most flowers you have to wait until they are fully open to look their best but Peonies look just as beautiful closed as they do open <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D> I have been thinking about taking a floristry course so this prize would be so lovely! I'd invite my mum GGill Baxterfor a girlie day out x"
"12149","I love tulips because they come from nothing and brighten up a dull spring day. They make me smile as they twist and turn and do their own thing in a vase and they come in sooo many different colours and textures. Equally they can be tamed as they were in my wedding bouquet <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0090> I would love to be able to arrange flowers so they show their true beauty <U+2764>"

"12152","My favourite flower since before I probably knew what it looked like, but more so now I do is the Chrysanthemum. Why? My middle names mean Beautiful Chrysanthemum - as soon as my dad told me as a little girl these have always topped my list!"
"12153","Night sky petunias are magical they look like they contain a sky full of stars and galaxies upon their petals. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00B8><ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+008C>

"12154","Anemone! My definite favourite. They are not around for long, making them special and to be enjoyed only for a short season but so so beautiful. Delicate, sophisticated and a work of natures art <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008D>. You can see some in the bunch of spring beauties held by my little flower  in my profile picture"
"12155","My favourite blooms are David Austin Juliet Roses. Their amazing peach ombre tones and fluffy petals remind me of tulle dresses. We are getting married in August next year and they will feature heavily in my bouquet. We are doing our ceremony flowers ourselves so a floristry workshop would help our dream day come true!!!"

"12157","I love spring flowers but especially the narcissus. A delicate bloom that says spring has sprung. They are something anyone can grow and enjoy. They speak for themselves in arrangements as well as complement foliage and other spring flowers."
"12158","I love all flowers but my favourite would have to be roses.  I had some beautiful vintage roses in my wedding boutique, absolutely stunning. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B2><U+0097> Love the new flower themed collection in Oasis, so pretty."

"12161","It's a bit of a cliche at this time of year but I absolutely love daffodils. You can't beat that radiant yellow after the darkness of winter. And this year was the first year I planted some bulbs on my balcony garden and now it is full of daffodils :-) When I was little I always thought I'd be a florist when I grew up so would love this prize."

"12164","Sunflowers because w
They are big and bold and bright while maintaining a delicate softness, they shouldn't be able to stand upright on those tall stems with such a large blooming head and yet they stand tall and im the midst of their beauty they also carry tasty seeds that once the flower has faded can offer nourishment :) bloomin brilliant flowers"
"12165","My favourite flowers are Carnations by a Country mile! They're beautiful and timeless. Carnation petals are so delicate and the frills look fantastic when paired with roses. My favourite combination is pink carnations with cream roses - it's such a simple but classic pairing that never fails to make me happy!"
"12166","I am fascinated not only by the fragrance, tone and form of flowers but also for the language of flowers. I choose Delphiniums and Bells of Ireland. Both striking, intricate and represent symbols of infinite possibility and luck."
"12167","My favourite flower is Celosia. Mainly the 'brain' form. As a florist I love using celosia, it adds such a different form and texture to our bouquets, and the vivid colours that they come in bring fabulous colour into all bouquets!"

"12172","I love peonys. There's something so romantic about them, with their soft colours and delicate, billowy petals. I really wanted them in my bridal bouquet, but the season finished early due to weather and my florist wasn't happy that he could source any of good enough quality. Still adore them though. <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00BA>"
"12173","It depends the season and feeling. But I love thistles, it gives me a sense of being home, in Scotland.

"12174","I love carnations. They come in the larger pinks size or the regular carnation smaller size and so many colours. I think they are over looked for being a cheaper flower, but the array of beautiful colours is vast. Plus they also look good next to all other flowers to compliment, with out over powering. Perfect. A colour for every event and mood."
"12175","That's hard so many beautiful flowers and it changes with the seasons .it would probably have to be gerberas and sunflowers ,like huge smiley faces <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+0081>impossible for them not to brighten your day xx"

"12391","Rose, the smell when they're in bloom reminds me of my grandparents' garden, from my childhood through to my adulthood, and where I lived for almost five years. There was a rosebed in the centre of the garden and since both of them passed and their house sold, the rose bushes were dug up and supplanted in the gardens of family and friends to keep growing, there will be cuttings taken and hopefully more bushes to come.

"12397","My favourite flower is a Rose! The reason being... when I was aged 2 I stood on a stool in a 3rd floor balcony and wanted to go play with my older brother who was down stairs on the path, I took a short cut and fell over!! Landed in a rose bush! Head first! ... just 2 inches from the concrete path! When we moved house my dad was gifted the rose bush from the neighbour and he planted it in his back garden, to this day it only ever sprouts 1 rose! Dads passed now but his rose bush is still there <U+2764><U+FE0F> <ed><U+00A0><U+00BC><ed><U+00BC><U+00B9><U+2764><U+FE0F> to me roses saved my life!

"12403","Daffodils, because it was the last thing my grandad could see when he was in a hospice, because they are bright. The cancer took his sight but the daffodils got through. We donated lots of daffodil bulbs to the hospice for future patients to benefit from. Also because he planted daffodils for us in our garden and each year they come up and brighten our garden and our lives as we remember him. I always think of him when I see a daffodil."
"12404","I like Bell Chrysanthemums because the globular symmetry is surreal and modern but at the same time, they ooze tradition and symbolism. Other times they are humorous, looking like a 17th Century french wig or pile of shaving foam :)"

"12406","Lisianthus, bearded irises, blue poppies (highly temperamental and impossible to grow) and these tiny little pink flowers...I forget  what they're called,  all for their delicacy. Oh and Fritillary flowers which I still hardly believe aren't painted that way. 

I despise gereberas for likely highly irrational reasons. Blurg.

*edited to say the tiny little pink flowers are wax flowers! Thank you Susan Catchpole, excellent choice and now I know what to ask for rather than hunting through the shop."
"12407","The stunning, vibrant and delicate gloriosa . It's so unusual and so striking ! It's a little luxury that really makes me smile and just lasts and lasts.
